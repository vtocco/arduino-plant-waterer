# arduino-plant-waterer
Code that runs the arduino plant waterer, checks water levels, uses a pump and two valves. 

There are 3 sensors, one in each plant, and one in the water bucket

Each of the sensors power is only turned on when we want a read from it. This allows longer life for them and reduces build-up.
